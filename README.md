👋 Welcome, I’m Nieng Lee, but I'd prefer to be called Yordan. I am a Chemistry enginner, with preferences in **Backend Developing** and **Data Science/Machine Learning**.

🧐**About Me**:

I'm really pasionated about the science and programming world, I am graduated as a **Chemistry Enginner** in the National University of Colombia, and I had studied **Data science** and **Machine Learning** in DataCamp. My objective is to integrate these two areas of science and with this, achieve important analyzes in chemical contexts to have greater clarity about the processses than can be carried out, and help whoever needs this to understand natural phenomena.

🌱Right now, I'm constantly learning about chemistry and programming, so, I´m studying in **Digital House** certified web development, and it is expected that I can continue learning other topics about my interests.

**What would you find here?**:

Here, you will find repositories related with development of group work for each course that I'm doing, also, here are project proposals about my interest and find solutions of those

💻**Skills in constant learning**:

⚪PYTHON --> Django for Backend ; Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Sklearn, Tensorflow/keras more than anything for data science
⚪HTML
⚪CSS
⚪JS
⚪SQL --> PostgreSQL most preferred by me for DB management
⚪LINUX --> starting with ubuntu, and then, to dominate Tails Linux and Kali linux
⚪Git/GitHub --> powerful tool to work remote and collaborative in team
⚪KNIME --> powerful tool to manipulate set of data
⚪PowerBI --> Just for Showing data to clairly way and manipulate data to make important decisions
⚪Bash

💻**Skills of my interest to develop**:

⚪Js/Typescript ⚪Goolang/(Framework Gin for Backend) ⚪Docker/Kubernets ⚪Scala ⚪Apache/hadoop(Pyspark) ⚪Google cloud or AWS ⚪Jenkins

🙋‍♂️**SoftSkills learnt**:

⚪Kanban ⚪SCRUM

🔭 I’m currently working on projects related with Backend development, Data science and Machine/deep learning, but I am more inclined towards projects where chemistry is involved, therefore,  I’m looking to collaborate on anything related with chemistry an engineering applying programming topics
